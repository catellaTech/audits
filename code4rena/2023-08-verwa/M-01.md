# Unsafe casting from int128 in VotingEscrow.createLock() can cause wrong accounting of locked amounts

## Vulnerability details
## Impact
The unsafe casting to int128 variable can cause its value to be different from the correct value. For example in the createLock function, the addition to the locked amount variable is done by locked_.amount += int128(int256(_value)). In that case, if value is greater than type(int128).max which is 2**127 - 1, then the accounting will be wrong and the amount that will be added to locked.amount will be less than the amount of token that will be transferred from the user. Then the user won't be able to withdraw the tokens that he transferred, and they'll be stuck in the contract forever.

## Proof of Concept
1. Alice tries to lock 2128 tokens. She calls createLock(2128, unlockTime) with the time she wants to lock for.

2. The addition of the given value is done by locked_.amount += int128(int256(value)), which actually does nothing to the locked.amount variable and it remains 0. That's because when casting int128(int256(2**128)) truncates to 0, and that leaves the locked amount unchanged but the tokens are transferred.

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Make sure that the values fit in the variables you are trying to assign them to when casting variables to smaller types or use SafeCast library by OZ.
