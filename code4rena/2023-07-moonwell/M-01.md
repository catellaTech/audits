## Vulnerability details
### Impact
Incorrect borrowBalance and token collateral values. Could lead to many different exploits, such as:

- Users with a collateral token that fell in price substancially can borrow another underlying whose price has not been updated and earn profit.
- Users can borrow/redeem/transfer more if the interest/price was not updated.

## Proof of Concept
In the Comptroller, the total collateral balance and borrow balance is calculated at getHypotheticalAccountLiquidityInternal(...). This function calculates these balances in this for loop.
As can be seen, the oracle price is not updated via calling updatePrice(...), nor the borrow interest is updated by calling AccrueInterest(...). Only the corresponding MToken that called the borrow(...), transfer(...) or redeem(...)` has an updated price and interest, which could lead to critical inaccuracies for accounts with several MTokens.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Update the price and interest of every collateral except the MToken that triggered the hook, which has already been updated
