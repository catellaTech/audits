## Vulnerability details
## Impact
The JumpRateModel.sol#L68.utilizationRate() function can return value above 1 and not between [0, 1e18].

### Proof of Concept
In the JumpRateModel.sol#L68.utilizationRate() function, cash, borrows and reserves values gets used to calculate utilization rate between between [0, 1e18]. `reserves` is currently unused but it will be used in the future.
```solidity
    function utilizationRate(uint cash, uint borrows, uint reserves) public pure returns (uint) {
        // Utilization rate is 0 when there are no borrows
        if (borrows == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        return borrows.mul(1e18).div(cash.add(borrows).sub(reserves));
    }
```    
If Borrow value is 0, then function will return 0 but in this function the scenario where the value of reserves exceeds cash is not handled.
The system does not guarantee that reserves never exceeds cash. the reserves grow automatically over time, so it might be difficult to avoid this entirely.

`If reserves > cash (and borrows + cash - reserves > 0)`, the formula for utilizationRate above gives a utilization rate above 1.

## Tools Used
Manual review

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Make the utilization rate computation return 1 if reserves > cash.
