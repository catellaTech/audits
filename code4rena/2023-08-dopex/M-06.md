## Lines of Code

## Vulnerability details
### Impact
In the code4rena dopex contests is especified the following about the `PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP` contract:
```shell
Contract for the Perpetual Atlantic Vault LP (ERC4626).
```

Although the contest documentation and certain parts of the contract describe the EIP-4626 standard, the protocol does not adhere to it.

### Proof of Concept
- https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/perp-vault/PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP.sol#L113
```solidity
  * @notice deposit into ERC4626 token
```

- https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/perp-vault/PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP.sol#L138

```solidity
 * @notice redeem ERC4626 token
```
For example is missing the `maxDeposit` for maximum amount of the underlying asset that can be deposited into the Vault for the receiver, through a deposit call.
and others.

### Tools Used
Manual review.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
Go through [the standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4626) and follow it for all methods that override methods from the inherited ERC4626 implementation.
