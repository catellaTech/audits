## Vulnerability details
### Impact
In the code4rena dopex contests is especified the following about the `PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP` contract:
```shell
Contract for the Perpetual Atlantic Vault LP (ERC4626).
```

But the `PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP.deposit/mint` functions do not work well with fee-on-transfer tokens as the assets variable is the pre-fee amount, including the fee, whereas the `totalAssets` do not include the fee anymore.

This vulnerability can result in malicious users getting more shares than they should have gotten when doing mint/deposit

### Proof of Concept
- https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/perp-vault/PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP.sol#L118-L135
```solidity
/**
   * @notice deposit into ERC4626 token
   * @param assets assets
   * @param receiver receiver
   * @return shares shares of LP tokens minted
   */
  function deposit(
    uint256 assets,
    address receiver
  ) public virtual returns (uint256 shares) {
    // Check for rounding error since we round down in previewDeposit.
    require((shares = previewDeposit(assets)) != 0, "ZERO_SHARES");

    perpetualAtlanticVault.updateFunding();

    // Need to transfer before minting or ERC777s could reenter.
    collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);

    _mint(receiver, shares);

    _totalCollateral += assets;

    emit Deposit(msg.sender, receiver, assets, shares);
  }
```
- https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-08-dopex/blob/main/contracts/perp-vault/PerpetualAtlanticVaultLP.sol#L128
```solidity
collateral.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), assets);
```
The implementation can be abused to mint more shares than desired for example:

A `deposit(1000)` should result in the same shares as two deposits of `deposit(500)` but it does not because `assets` is the pre-fee amount.

Assume a fee-on-transfer of `20%`. Assume current `totalAmount = 1000`, `totalShares = 1000` for simplicity.

`deposit(1000) = 1000 / totalAmount * totalShares = 1000 shares`.

`deposit(500) = 500 / totalAmount * totalShares = 500 shares`. Now the `totalShares` increased by 500 but the `totalAssets` only increased by `(100% - 20%) * 500 = 400`. Therefore, the second `deposit(500) = 500 / (totalAmount + 400) * (newTotalShares) = 500 / (1400) * 1500 = 535.714285714 shares`.

In total, the two deposits lead to `35` more shares than a single deposit of the sum of the deposits.

### Tools Used
Manual review.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps
`assets` should be the amount excluding the fee, i.e., the amount the contract actually received.

This can be done by subtracting the pre-contract balance from the post-contract balance.
However, this would create another issue with ERC777 tokens.

Maybe `previewDeposit` should be overwritten by vaults supporting fee-on-transfer tokens to predict the post-fee amount and do the shares computation on that.
