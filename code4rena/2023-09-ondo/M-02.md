## Summary
In the `rescueToken` function, it opens the door to potential insecurity for user funds because it lacks additional conditions specifying which types of tokens or under what conditions the onlyOwner can use this function.

The function looks like:
- https://github.com/code-423n4/2023-09-ondo/blob/main/contracts/bridge/DestinationBridge.sol#L322-L325

```solidity
  /**
   * @notice Admin function used to rescue ERC20 Tokens sent to the contract
   *
   * @param _token The address of the token to rescue
   */
  function rescueTokens(address _token) external onlyOwner {
    uint256 balance = IRWALike(_token).balanceOf(address(this));
    IRWALike(_token).transfer(owner(), balance);
  }
```

## Impact
Owner can steal the user funds.


## Tools Used
Manual review 

## Recommended Mitigation Steps
Improve the logic of this function and specify under what circumstances the owner can use it without jeopardizing user funds.
